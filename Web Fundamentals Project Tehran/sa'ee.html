    <h1>A Green Park in the heart of Tehran</h1>
    <p>
      Many years ago when late Engineer Karim Saei planned to build this park , in a time when Tehran was not so crowded , he may have guessed that this green field with small trees and bushes would one day grow so high that would be one of the most beautiful parks in the 10 million inhabitant of Iranian capital .
      Nowadays with the polluted Tehran atmosphere and the need for a green , quite place people have no way except referring to such places where they can enjoy green view along with shades of the tall trees and cold air in the place where the park is surrounded by Vali-e Asr street in one side and Vozara street in the other with so many tall buildings in both sides even facing the park itself.

    <h1>A jewel in the middle of noise and crowd</h1>

      I used to stare at this park for around 3 years when my office was exactly next to Sa'ee park. It's one of the oldest parks in Tehran.
