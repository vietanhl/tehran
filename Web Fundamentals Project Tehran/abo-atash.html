    <h1>An excellent tourist Park in Tehran</h1>
    <p>
      Ab-o-Atash Park is one of the most attractive places in Tehran that includes tons of interesting areas. A great choice for walking, playing as well as having a special food in one of the several different type of restaurants over there.

    <h1>Big and different</h1>
    <p>
      Big Park which is suitable for walking and taking photos, its resturants are in midrange with no espacial food and a little more expensive than other restorants in Tehran. I suggest not to go there on Thursdays and Fridays night, It is too crowded.
