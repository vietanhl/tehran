      <A NAME="section1"><h>Iran National Museum</h></A><hr>
    	<p> The National Museum of Iran is one of the must see Tourist sights in Tehran, This museum is the combination of two museums, the old Muze-ye Iran-e Bastan (“Archaeological Museum of Iran”, a break, Sasanian revival building designed by André Godard and inaugurated in 1937), The second structure, built on the grassy grounds of the old Archaeological Museum, went through quite a few, and hasty changes of the interior, and was still being remodeled when the Islamic Revolution swept the country in 1979. </p>
      <h1> Subjects inside the Iran National Museum </h1>
      <p>The oldest artefact in the museum are from Kashafrud, Darband and Ganj Par, sites that date back to the Lower Paleolithic period. Mousterian stone tools made by Neanderthals are also on display in the first hall. The most important Upper Paleolithic tools are from the Yafteh Cave, dating back approximately 30,000-35,000 years. There are also 9,000 year old human and animal figurines from Teppe Sarab in Kermanshah Province among the many other ancient artifacts.

Among the finds from Shush , there’s a stone capital of a winged lion, some delightful pitchers and vessels in animal shapes, and colourful glazed bricks decorated with double-winged mythical creatures. A copy of the diarite stele detailing the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, found at Shush in 1901, is also displayed – the original being in Paris.

Exhibits from Persepolis include a magnificent human-headed capital; a cuneiform inscription proclaiming the might and godly affinity of Xerxes; and a striking frieze of glazed tiles from the central hall of the Apadana Palace. Also on display are a famous trilingual inscription from the time of Darius I; a bull-headed capital and carved staircase; a statue of a sitting dog that looks like it was carved just weeks ago; and four foundation tablets inscribed in cuneiform.

One of the more startling exhibits is the Salt Man from Zanjan. He’s thought to have been a miner who died in the 3rd or 4th century AD, but whose white-bearded head, leg in a leather boot and tools were preserved by the salt in which he was buried. More comical is a bronze statue Parthian prince ‘Shami’ found in Khuzestan, whose cheesy moustache looks out from a head obviously made separately from the much larger body. Look also for the impressive selection of Lorestan bronzes , dating back to the 8th century BC.

    </p><h1> What to see when visiting Golestan Palace? </h1>
      <p>
        The Marble Throne (Takht-e Marmar): This spectacular terrace known as Takht-e Marmar, Or Marble Throne, was built in 1806 by order of Fath Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797-1834).

The Marble Throne is one of the oldest buildings of the historic Golestan Palace.

The Hoz Khane (Pool Room): Works of European painters presented to the Qajar court are housed in the Hoze Khane, The Hoze Khane was used as a summer chamber during the Qajar ear. A special cooling system pumped water form a subterranean system of streams (qanats) and in this case the king’s qanat into small ponds inside the chambers. Hoz means pool, thus the name Hoz Khane. The system was designed to pass through as many summer rooms as was necessary. The water was then channeled outside to irrigate the royal gardens.

Talar-e Ayene (Mirror Hall): is the most famous of the Golestan Palace hall’s. This relatively small hall is famous for its extraordinary mirror work. The Hall was designed by Haj Abdoul Hossein Memar bashi (Sanie-ol-Molk).Yahaya Khan Moetamed-ol-Molk,the Minister of Architecture,acted as consultant to the designer.

Talar-e Salam (reception Hall): This Reception Hall was originally designed to be a museum, After the Takht-e-Tavoos (Iranian’s famous Jeweled Peacock Throne) was moved to the Royal jewels collection at the Central Bank, this hall was designated to hold special receptions in the presence of the king, hence the name Talar Salam. Tourists and envoys from European courts received in the Palace during the reign of Nasser-ol-Din Shah, spoke of this outstanding hall comparing it to its European counterparts. The reception hall has exquisite mirrors work. The ceiling and walls are decorated with plaster molding. The floors are covered with mosaic.During the reign of Nasser-ol-Din Shah, this hall was used to exhibit Iranian and European paintings alongside gifts presented to the Iranian court. Royal jewels were also exhibited inside glass cases. These jewels are now housed at the Royal Jewels Museum of the Central Bank.

Shams Ol Emare (The edifice of Sun): The most stunning structures of the Golestan Palace, The idea of building a tall structure came to Nasser-ol-Din Shah before his first European and from pictorial images of European buildings. The Monarch wanted a structure from which he could have panoramic views of the city. Designed by Moayer-ol-Mamalek, construction on the Shams-ol-Emareh began in 1865 and was completed two years later. The architect was Master Ali Mohammad Kashi. The building has two identical towers. The exterior views have multiple arches, intricate tile work and ornate windows. This building is a fusion of Persian and European architecture.

Emarat-e Badgir (The wind tower Building): constructed during the reign of Fath Ali Shah (circa 1806). The building underwent major renovations, including structural changes, during the reign of Nasser-ol-Din Shah.

There is a central room which boasts the finest stained glass window in Golestan Palace. Outside, there are four wind towers of blue, yellow and black glazed tiles and a golden cupola. The wind towers are constructed to allow the cooling wind to move through the structure.

Talar-e Almas (The Diamonds Hall): Is located in the southern wing of Golestan Palace next to the Badgir Building. It is called Hall of Diamonds because of the exceptional mirror work inside the building. The construction of this hall dates to the time of Fath Ali Shah (circa1806). Nasser-ol-Din Shah renovated this hall changing its appearance and replacing the hall’s Ogival arches with Roman ones. He also ordered the walls covered with wallpaper imported from Europe. As the basic structure dates back to the time of Fath Ali Shah, it is only. It is only apt that this hall should be devoted to the exhibition of art and handicrafts from that period.

 <A NAME="section3"><h>Tehran Grand Bazaar</h></A><hr>
<p>
Throughout its history, in addition to shops the Grand bazaar as one of the remarkably Tehran Tourist Attractions has contained banks and financiers, mosques and guest houses. Traditionally, the Tehran Grand bazaar was split into corridors, each specialising in different types of goods, including copper, carpets, paper, spices, and precious metals, as well as small traders selling all types of goods. Today, modern goods are available as well, in addition to the many traditional corridor traders that still survive.
<br>
The area around Tehran Grand Bazaar has been settled since at least 6,000 BC, and while bazaar-like construction in Iran as a whole has been dated as far back as 4,000 BC, Tehran’s bazaar is not this old. It is hard to say exactly when the Tehran Grand Bazaar first appeared, but in the centuries following the introduction of Islam, travellers reported the growth of commerce in the area now occupied by the current bazaar.
</p>
<h1>Visiting Tehran grand bazaar</h1>
<p>The Tehran Grand bazaar is still an important place of commerce for Tehranis, Iranians, travelling merchants and increasingly a good Tourist sight to wander. However, much of the trade and finance in the city has moved to the north of the city, leaving the bazaar somewhat decreased in importance. Still, in addition to the traditional goods on sale, the market for watches and local jewellery is apparently growing, most likely for the benefits of tourists.

As is in keeping with the market spirit, tourists are encouraged to haggle. The bazaar is busiest around midday, and between 17:00 and 19:00.
