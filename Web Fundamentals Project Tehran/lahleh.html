      Laleh Park in Tehran is a very place to rest, to spend some time with friends, chatting or just alone dreaming and following nice thoughts

      this park is so friendly and lovely in my view. Apparently it was so called as Farah Park after the name of Iran's last queen. I suggest this park to all
